Project Leading Questions:

Weâ€™ve entered the project with multiple leading questions, we wanted to research a transportation network and see what 
we can learn from it, and whether we can learn information that could help them make decisions. 
The leading questions for our project are:

How does the average trip look like?
What can we tell about intended paid trips?
What is the most common route?
Which stations are popular?
Do the most used stations vary yearly?
What are the main areas of the service?

We will use many network analysis tools like networkX library.
