In this project we will preprocess the data and in order to build a classification machine learning model
that tries to predict if the fare is lower or higher then $10. After training the model, given a set of (previously unseen) test data (w/o the fare) 
we want to predict (classify) for each row if the fare is < 10 or >= 10.

In this project we used Pyspark and runned the notebook on an EMR instance on AWS. 
EMR version : 5.29.0
