Data : 
Our database consists of 5,863 X-Ray images organized into 3 folders (train, test, val) containing subfolders for each image category (Pneumonia/Normal).

The database can be downloaded from here: https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia

The chest X-ray images in this dataset were selected from retrospective cohorts of pediatric patients of one to five years old from Guangzhou Women
and Children’s Medical Center, Guangzhou. All chest X-ray imaging was performed as part of patients’ routine clinical care.

For the analysis of chest x-ray images, all chest radiographs were initially screened for quality control by removing all low quality or unreadable scans.
The diagnoses for the images were then graded by two expert physicians before being cleared for training the AI system. 
In order to account for any grading errors, the evaluation set was also checked by a third expert.

Project Objective:
Chest X-rays are widely used in clinical practice, being cheap and easy to perform, and having a wide range of uses in the diagnosis
and treatment of lung and cardiovascular disease. As the number of radiologists who interpret these photos is limited,
the number of chest X-rays increases rapidly. Our project goal is to show that DL tools can be used in order to assist in the detection,
improve and take some of the load caused in the process of Pneumonia diagnosis, and help give better and faster treatment
to the patients & improve the whole decoder system.

To lead this project we will use ML and DL tools like Pytorch in order to make predictions.
